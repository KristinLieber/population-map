# population-map
Uses data visualization tool D3 to illustrate the distribution of the American population across cities and states.

Place all four files in the same folder and spin up a local server and the map should run as a webpage.  The map 
demonstrates several interactive features including zooming, panning, selection, color, shape size, buttons, and 
hovering for additional information.
